# Speech Denosing using RNN

Training data consists of 1200 noisy speech samples where 10 contiguous samples are the same senteces spoken by the same speaker with different noise signals. Same goes with the validation set. The model maked use of LSTM and acheives an SNR of 11 dB on the validation set.
