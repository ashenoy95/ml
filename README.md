* __em.py__: EM algorithm for a Mixture of Gaussians on one-dimensional data.

* __mnist.py__: MLP (1024x5 hidden units) using ReLU activation with He initialization and Adam optimization giving over 98% accuracy, implemented in TensorFlow.

* __parity.py__: MLP (4-4-1) with backprop from scratch to solve the parity problem for a 4-bit input.
